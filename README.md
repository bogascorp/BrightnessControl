You can configure autostart and hotkeys using the settings accessibly via the system tray icon context menu. By default, you can use Alt + Add and Alt + Subtract to change your monitor's brightness settings. Alternatively, you can click on the system tray icon to open the brightness / contrast overlay.

## System requirements
